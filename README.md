# cognitivePupillometry
This project uses eye-tracking and pupillometry to explore memory processes in adults.

Across many cultures, adults use spatial representations of time to help remember the temporal order of events. The existence of a mental timeline for conceptualizing temporal information can be assessed beyond behavioral accuracy measures. This project uses eye-tracking and pupillometry to explore how the mental timeline may interact with episodic memory. In this experiment, we investigate 1) whether participants spontaneously organize the temporal order of triplets in terms of a mental timeline and 2) whether the spatial presentation of the stimuli influences mental effort and attention during memory encoding. 

Currently a work in progress. Code for the project and the analysis can be available upon request.
